Hi! I'm Jess, a PhD student at the University of Toronto. I mainly wrangle big data, and write spaghetti code to get things done (and then suffer the consequences later). 

My main projects at the moment include working with [Logan](https://github.com/IndexThePlanet/Logan){:target="_blank"} to discover new viruses, enzymes, and whatever nucleic acid-based entities that might be out there.

I'm always looking for collaborations or cool project ideas - shoot me an email!
